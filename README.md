# Night-Light
An app that mimics a night light with a count down to darkness.

It was mostly a test of using the countdown and adjusting the display settings as well as the fact that I needed a night light.

There is an issue where if the user has made it so the device will never sleep (in settings blah blah blah) then it will never sleep.
